### What can Ouvrai do for me?

**Are you looking for an efficient, cost-effective way to conduct online behavioral research?**

**Do you want to run immersive, interactive experiments that go way beyond surveys, briefly flashed images, and response times?**

**Look no further!** Ouvrai is a comprehensive solution that streamlines the entire process of creating and running advanced behavioral studies with remote participants. Best of all, it’s entirely open-source and free, except for what you pay your participants.

With Ouvrai, you can:

1. Accelerate the development of experiment code with fast 2D and 3D graphics and support for a range of input devices.
2. Enjoy free web hosting and cloud database services for your experiments, so you don't have to worry about extra costs.
3. Seamlessly recruit and pay participants via trusted platforms like Prolific and Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Ouvrai offers an unparalleled advantage when it comes to studying movement and interaction in virtual reality, allowing you to easily design studies that capture exceptionally high-quality kinematic data at up to 120 Hz, including the position and orientation of the head and handheld controllers. Remote participants use their personal VR devices to access your studies over the web, making Ouvrai a perfect solution for studying human movement and motor control. If you are willing to learn the basics of JavaScript, our template experiments will have you coding up your own online VR studies in no time!

### Etymology

Ouvrai sounds like _ouvrir_, the French verb meaning "to open", because it opens access to high-quality online studies of human behavior for researchers and participants around the world. It’s also a (partial) acronym for Online Unmoderated Virtual Reality — the new type of study that Ouvrai makes possible.
